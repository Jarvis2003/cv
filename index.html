        <p>I am Yash Khandelwal also knowns as Jarvis ingame. I am persuing BCA with AI from <a href=https://lnct.ac.in />Lnct University Bhopal</a>.
          I also am a competetive apex mlegends mobile gamer, I have been playing mobile game since
          3 years I started playing competetive, my first game which I compete in was <a href=https://www.callofduty.com/mobile>Call of Duty mobile</a>, a classic
          5v5 fps game this was the first game in which i thought i could play games for a living and this could be
          a potential job. How cool would it be to tell someone that my job is to play games and I get paid for,
          hopefully I might someday</p>
